// what is linked list?
// it's a linear data structure and elements are linked together using pointers. We have different nodes within linked list. 

// The first node is called the head. Each node has two things: it has the actual data and it has pointers/reference to next element in the linked list. 

// The very last node one has a tail and it references to null. And this is how you know it's end of the list. 

// Everything stems from the head.

// create specific node and have linked list class.

// before we do, here's a very simple example. 

// node 1 with data equals 100
const n1 = {
  data: 100
}

// node 2 with data equals 200.
const n2 = {
  data: 200
}
